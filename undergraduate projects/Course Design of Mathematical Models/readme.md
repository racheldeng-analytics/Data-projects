# üß¨ Stability Analysis and Visualization of a Two-Species Competition Model

## üìò Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes the **stability of a two-species competition model** using **differential equations** and **Matlab App Designer**.  
The goal is to explore how two species compete for limited resources, determine the conditions for coexistence or extinction, and visualize population dynamics under varying parameters.  
The project applies **mathematical modeling**, **stability theory**, and **numerical simulation** to provide theoretical support for ecological and environmental protection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Description

### üß© Model Assumptions
1. Two populations, *x(t)* and *y(t)*, follow the **Logistic growth law** when living independently.  
2. Each population negatively affects the other's growth rate in proportion to its population size.  
3. The model assumes a **shared food source** and limited environmental capacity.

### üìà Mathematical Model
The model is based on the following system of differential equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{dx}{dt} = r_1x(1 - \frac{x + \alpha y}{N_1}) \\
\frac{dy}{dt} = r_2y(1 - \frac{y + \beta x}{N_2})
\end{cases}
\]

where  
- \( x(t), y(t) \): population sizes of species X and Y  
- \( r_1, r_2 \): intrinsic growth rates  
- \( N_1, N_2 \): carrying capacities  
- \( \alpha, \beta \): competition coefficients  

### üßÆ Stability Analysis
- Linearized the nonlinear system and analyzed equilibrium points.  
- Identified four equilibrium states:  
  1. Both species extinct  
  2. Species X dominates  
  3. Species Y dominates  
  4. Coexistence equilibrium  

Stability was determined using **eigenvalue analysis** and **Jacobian matrix** methods.  
Different parameter configurations lead to outcomes such as extinction, dominance, or coexistence.

## üíª Visualization Design

The visualization was implemented in **Matlab App Designer** and consists of:
- **Login interface** ‚Äì includes entry, exit, and information display functions.  
- **Visualization interface** ‚Äì allows users to:
  - Adjust model parameters interactively  
  - Plot real-time population trends  
  - Save or clear results  
  - Exit the program  

### üñºÔ∏è Example Output
The app dynamically displays how population trajectories change under different growth rates and carrying capacities.  
Users can simulate:
- Faster growth rate of one species ‚Üí quicker dominance  
- Higher carrying capacity ‚Üí slower stabilization  
- Different initial populations ‚Üí altered convergence speed

## üîç Key Findings
- Growth rate, carrying capacity, and initial conditions affect **stabilization speed**, but not the qualitative outcome.  
- **Competition coefficients** fundamentally determine whether species coexist or one dominates.  
- The model effectively predicts coexistence or extinction, offering potential applications in **ecological management** and **market competition modeling**.
