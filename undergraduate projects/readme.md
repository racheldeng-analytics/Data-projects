# 💳 Customer Points Management System

## 📘 Overview
This project is a **Customer Points Management System** developed in **C++** as part of a Data Structures course.  
It manages customer information, tracks purchase points, and applies tiered discounts based on accumulated points.  
The system uses **linked lists** for dynamic data storage, ensuring efficient record management and flexibility.

## ⚙️ Features
- ➕ Add, delete, and modify customer information  
- 🧮 Calculate reward points based on purchase amount  
- 💰 Apply discount levels according to total points  
- 🔍 Search for customers by ID  
- 📋 Display all customer records  
- 🔢 Count total number of customers

## 🧩 System Design
- **Language:** C++  
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio 2022  
- **Data Structure:** Linked list  
- **Core Modules:**
  - `addCustomer()` – Add new customers and calculate points  
  - `findCustomer()` – Search customers by ID  
  - `modifyCustomer()` – Update customer data  
  - `deleteCustomer()` – Remove customer information  
  - `displayCustomers()` – List all customers  
  - `statistics()` – Show total number of customers
