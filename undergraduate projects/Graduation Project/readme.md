# 📊 The Impact of China’s Population Change Trends on Life Insurance Demand

## 📘 Overview
This project is an undergraduate thesis analyzing how China’s shifting population structure — including **aging, gender balance, and urbanization** — affects the **demand for life insurance**.  
It combines **theoretical analysis** with **empirical modeling**, using the **GM(1,1) grey prediction model** and **PLS regression** to forecast demographic trends and quantify their impact on life insurance consumption.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict future population changes (2024–2028) in terms of **age, gender**, and **urban–rural distribution** using the GM(1,1) model.  
- Examine how demographic variables influence **life insurance demand**.  
- Provide **strategic recommendations** for insurance companies and policymakers.

## 🧮 Methodology
### 🔹 Data Sources
- *China Statistical Yearbook (2013–2023)*  
- *China Insurance Yearbook (2005–2023)*  

### 🔹 Models Used
- **GM(1,1) Grey Prediction Model** – for population and demographic forecasting.  
- **Multiple Linear Regression** – for preliminary demand analysis.  
- **PLS Regression** – to address multicollinearity and improve interpretability.  

### 🔹 Data Processing
- Missing value imputation  
- Logarithmic transformation  
- Multicollinearity diagnostics

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Urbanization rate** is the most influential factor affecting life insurance demand.  
- **Life insurance demand is self-reinforcing**, with previous premium income being a strong predictor of future demand.  
- The **aging population** and **declining birth rate** suggest growing demand for long-term and annuity products.  
- The **gender ratio** has minimal effect due to narrowing socio-economic gaps.

## 💡 Practical Implications
### For Insurers
- Design **customized insurance products** targeting urban middle-class and rural consumers.
