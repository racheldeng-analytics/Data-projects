## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project focuses on the **numerical computation of initial value problems for ordinary differential equations (ODEs)** and their application to real-world modeling â€” specifically, simulating the **ascent process of a small single-stage rocket**.  
Through theoretical validation and numerical experiments, the report compares several numerical methods, including:
- Euler Method  
- Improved Euler Method  
- Trapezoidal Method  
- Rungeâ€“Kutta Method (4th order)

The project also builds a mathematical model of rocket ascent to analyze the relationships between **velocity, height, and acceleration over time**, providing insights into optimizing rocket design and fuel efficiency.
